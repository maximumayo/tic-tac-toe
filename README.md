# tic-tac-toe hackathon

### Project Notes 
- Make a tic-tac-toe game
  - at least 2 players
  - at least 3x3 board size
  - players alternate in some way or form
  - one player should be able to win (though is not guaranteed)
- Additional requirements:
  - at least 2 board sizes
  - Dynamic win condition generation: no hard-coded if statements or data structures to determine win conditions.  Such structures can be made, but must be made dynamically via code, not hand-coded in the final product.
  - players must be able to choose which symbol they use

### The Team
* Max Mayo (myself)
* Trisha Meyer
* Frank Ruiz
* This was a great group project that required vision/goal coordination
* We identified what we wanted to do, had to do and what we thought we could do
